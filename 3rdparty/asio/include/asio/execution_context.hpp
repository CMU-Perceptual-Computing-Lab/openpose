/// A context for function object execution.
/**
 * An execution context represents a place where function objects will be
 * executed. An @c io_context is an example of an execution context.
 *
 * @par The execution_context class and services
 *
 * Class execution_context implements an extensible, type-safe, polymorphic set
 * of services, indexed by service type.
 *
 * Services exist to manage the resources that are shared across an execution
 * context. For example, timers may be implemented in terms of a single timer
 * queue, and this queue would be stored in a service.
 *
 * Access to the services of an execution_context is via three function
 * templates, use_service(), add_service() and has_service().
 *
 * In a call to @c use_service<Service>(), the type argument chooses a service,
 * making available all members of the named type. If @c Service is not present
 * in an execution_context, an object of type @c Service is created and added
 * to the execution_context. A C++ program can check if an execution_context
 * implements a particular service with the function template @c
 * has_service<Service>().
 *
 * Service objects may be explicitly added to an execution_context using the
 * function template @c add_service<Service>(). If the @c Service is already
 * present, the service_already_exists exception is thrown. If the owner of the
 * service is not the same object as the execution_context parameter, the
 * invalid_service_owner exception is thrown.
 *
 * Once a service reference is obtained from an execution_context object by
 * calling use_service(), that reference remains usable as long as the owning
 * execution_context object exists.
 *
 * All service implementations have execution_context::service as a public base
 * class. Custom services may be implemented by deriving from this class and
 * then added to an execution_context using the facilities described above.
 *
 * @par The execution_context as a base class
 *
 * Class execution_context may be used only as a base class for concrete
 * execution context types. The @c io_context is an example of such a derived
 * type.
 *
 * On destruction, a class that is derived from execution_context must perform
 * <tt>execution_context::shutdown()</tt> followed by
 * <tt>execution_context::destroy()</tt>.
 *
 * This destruction sequence permits programs to simplify their resource
 * management by using @c shared_ptr<>. Where an object's lifetime is tied to
 * the lifetime of a connection (or some other sequence of asynchronous
 * operations), a @c shared_ptr to the object would be bound into the handlers
 * for all asynchronous operations associated with it. This works as follows:
 *
 * @li When a single connection ends, all associated asynchronous operations
 * complete. The corresponding handler objects are destroyed, and all @c
 * shared_ptr references to the objects are destroyed.
 *
 * @li To shut down the whole program, the io_context function stop() is called
 * to terminate any run() calls as soon as possible. The io_context destructor
 * calls @c shutdown() and @c destroy() to destroy all pending handlers,
 * causing all @c shared_ptr references to all connection objects to be
 * destroyed.

   * function, or any function associated with the execution_context's derived
   * class, is being called in another thread. It is, however, safe to call
   * this function from within a completion handler, provided no other thread

   * fails the execution_context object should no longer be used and should be

   *
   * @par Example
   * The following code illustrates how to incorporate the notify_fork()
   * function:
   * @code my_execution_context.notify_fork(execution_context::fork_prepare);
   * if (fork() == 0)
   * {
   *   // This is the child process.
   *   my_execution_context.notify_fork(execution_context::fork_child);

   * else
   * {
   *   // This is the parent process.
   *   my_execution_context.notify_fork(execution_context::fork_parent);
   * } @endcode
   *
   * @note For each service object @c svc in the execution_context set,
   * performs <tt>svc->notify_fork();</tt>. When processing the fork_prepare
   * event, services are visited in reverse order of the beginning of service
   * object lifetime. Otherwise, services are visited in order of the beginning
