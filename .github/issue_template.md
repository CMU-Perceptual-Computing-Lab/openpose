### Posting rules
1. **Add** the **system configuration (all of it!), command and output** if you have some kind of error or performance question.
2. **No duplicated** posts.
3. **No** posts about **questions already answered / clearly explained in** the **documentation** (e.g. **no more low-speed nor out-of-memory questions**).
4. Set a **proper issue title**: add the Ubuntu/Windows word and be specific (e.g. do not simple call it: `Compile error`).
5. Only English comments.
Issues/comments that do not follow this will be **ignored or removed** with no further clarification.
