### Posting rules
1. **No** questions about **training**. OpenPose only implements testing.
2. **No** questions about **Caffe installation errors/issues**. Check [Caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org) documentation and help for those errors.
3. **No** questions about **CUDA check failed errors**. These errors are usually fixed by re-installing CUDA, re-installing the proper cuDNN version, and re-compiling (or re-installing) OpenPose. Otherwise, check for help in CUDA forums.
4. **Fill** the **Your System Configuration section (all of it!)** if you have some kind of error or performance question.
5. **No duplicated** posts.
6. **No** posts about **questions already answered / clearly explained in** the **documentation** (e.g. **no more low-speed nor out-of-memory questions**).
7. Set a **proper issue title**: add the Ubuntu/Windows word and be specific (e.g. do not simple call it: `Compile error`).
8. Only English comments.
Issues/comments which do not follow these rules will be **ignored or removed** with no further clarification.
