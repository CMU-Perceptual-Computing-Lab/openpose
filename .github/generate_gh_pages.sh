# Date created  : 2016/02/22
# Notes         :
__AUTHOR__="openpose"
# Preconditions:
# - Packages doxygen doxygen-doc doxygen-latex doxygen-gui graphviz
#   must be installed.
# - Doxygen configuration file must have the destination directory empty and
#   source code directory with a $(TRAVIS_BUILD_DIR) prefix.
# - An gh-pages branch should already exist. See below for mor info on hoe to
#   create a gh-pages branch.
#
# Required global variables:
# - TRAVIS_BUILD_NUMBER : The number of the current build.
# - TRAVIS_COMMIT       : The commit that the current build is testing.
# - DOXYFILE            : The Doxygen configuration file.
# - GH_REPO_NAME        : The name of the repository.
# - GH_REPO_REF         : The GitHub reference to the repository.
# - GH_REPO_TOKEN       : Secure token to the github repository.
#
# For information on how to encrypt variables for Travis CI please go to
# https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/environment-variables/#Encrypted-Variables
# or https://gist.github.com/vidavidorra/7ed6166a46c537d3cbd2
# For information on how to create a clean gh-pages branch from the master
# branch, please go to https://gist.github.com/vidavidorra/846a2fc7dd51f4fe56a0
#
# This script will generate Doxygen documentation and push the documentation to
# the gh-pages branch of a repository specified by GH_REPO_REF.
# Before this script is used there should already be a gh-pages branch in the
# repository.

# documentation.

# Presumably this is only needed when the SHORT_NAMES option in Doxygen is set
# to NO, which it is by default. So creating the file just in case.
