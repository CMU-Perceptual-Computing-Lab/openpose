# This is my working version of openpose.

### Requirements to run:
Ubuntu 20.04
Caffe (built automatically)
Python: 3.8
CUDA: 11.1
CUDA toolkit
CUDNN: Tried with latest version( for CUDA 11.1) but didn't worked. So not used
OpenCV: 4.5.1
pybind11: v2.3.dev0

#### As my NVIDIA-GPU is of 4GB so openpose runs only if `--net_resolution -1x256` is added as argument
