## Introduction
OpenPose represents the **first real-time system to jointly detect human body, hand and facial keypoints (in total 130 keypoints) on single images**. In addition, the system computational performance on body keypoint estimation is invariant to the number of detected people in the image. It uses Caffe, but it could easily be ported to other frameworks (Tensorflow, Torch, etc.). If you implement any of those, feel free to make a pull request!

OpenPose is authored by [Gines Hidalgo](http://gineshidalgo.com/), [Zhe Cao](http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/zhecao), [Tomas Simon](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tsimon/), [Shih-En Wei](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=sFQD3k4AAAAJ&hl=en), [Hanbyul Joo](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~hanbyulj/) and [Yaser Sheikh](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~yaser/). In addition, it is being maintained by [Gines Hidalgo](http://gineshidalgo.com/) and [Bikramjot Hanzra](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bikz05).

In addition, OpenPose would not be possible without the [CMU Panoptic Studio](http://domedb.perception.cs.cmu.edu/).

The pose estimation work is based on the C++ code from [the ECCV 2016 demo](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/caffe_rtpose), "Realtime Multiperson Pose Estimation", [Zhe Cao](http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/zhecao), [Tomas Simon](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tsimon/), [Shih-En Wei](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=sFQD3k4AAAAJ&hl=en), [Yaser Sheikh](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~yaser/). The [original repo](https://github.com/ZheC/Multi-Person-Pose-Estimation) includes Matlab and Python version, as well as the training code.


## Functionality
- Multi-person 15 or **18-keypoint body pose** estimation and rendering. **Running time invariant to number of people** on the image.
- Multi-person **2x21-keypoint hand** estimation and rendering. Note: In this initial version, **running time** linearly **depends** on the **number of people** on the image.
- Multi-person **70-keypoint face** estimation and rendering. Note: In this initial version, **running time** linearly **depends** on the **number of people** on the image.
- Flexible and easy-to-configure **multi-threading** module.
- Image, video, webcam and IP camera reader.
- Able to save and load the results in various formats (JSON, XML, PNG, JPG, ...).
- Small display and GUI for simple result visualization.
- All the functionality is wrapped into a **simple-to-use OpenPose Wrapper class**.



## Installation, Reinstallation and Uninstallation
You can find the installation, reinstallation and uninstallation steps on: [doc/installation.md](doc/installation.md).



## Quick Start
Most users cases should not need to dive deep into the library, they might just be able to use the [Demo](#demo) or the simple [OpenPose Wrapper](#openpose-wrapper). So you can most probably skip the library details in [OpenPose Library](#openpose-library).


### Demo
Your case if you just want to process a folder of images or video or webcam and display or save the pose results.

Forget about the OpenPose library details and just read the [doc/demo_overview.md](doc/demo_overview.md) 1-page section.


### OpenPose Wrapper
Your case if you want to read a specific format of image source and/or add a specific post-processing function and/or implement your own display/saving.

(Almost) forget about the library, just take a look to the `Wrapper` tutorial on [examples/tutorial_wrapper/](examples/tutorial_wrapper/).

Note: you should not need to modify the OpenPose source code nor examples. In this way, you are able to directly upgrade OpenPose anytime in the future without changing your code. You might create your custom code on [examples/user_code/](examples/user_code/) and compile it by using `make all` in the OpenPose folder.


### OpenPose Library
Your case if you want to change internal functions and/or extend its functionality.

1. Take a look at the [Demo](#demo) and [OpenPose Wrapper](#openpose-wrapper).
2. OpenPose Overview: Learn the basics about the library source code in [doc/library_overview.md](doc/library_overview.md).
3. Extending Functionality: Learn how to extend the library in [doc/library_extend_functionality.md](doc/library_extend_functionality.md).
4. Adding An Extra Module: Learn how to add an extra module in [doc/library_add_new_module.md](doc/library_add_new_module.md).
5. See the Doxygen documentation on [http://cmu-perceptual-computing-lab.github.io/openpose/html/index.html](http://cmu-perceptual-computing-lab.github.io/openpose/html/index.html) or build it from the source code.



## Output
Check the output (format, keypoint index ordering, etc.) in [doc/output.md](doc/output.md).



## Standalone Face Or Hand Keypoint Detector
If you do not need the body keypoint detector and want to considerably speed up the face keypoint detection, you can use the new approach based on OpenCV face detector. See [doc/standalone_face_or_hand_keypoint_detector.md](doc/standalone_face_or_hand_keypoint_detector.md).

You can also use the OpenPose hand and/or face keypoint detectors with your own face or hand detectors, rather than using the body keypoint detector as initial detector for those. E.g. in case of hand camera views at which the hands are visible but not the rest of the body, so that the OpenPose detector would fail. See [doc/standalone_face_or_hand_keypoint_detector.md](doc/standalone_face_or_hand_keypoint_detector.md).



## Speed Up OpenPose and Benchmark
Check the OpenPose Benchmark and some hints to speed up OpenPose on [doc/installation.md#faq](doc/installation.md#faq).



## Send Us Failure Cases!
If you find videos or images where OpenPose does not seems to work well, feel free to send them to openposecmu@gmail.com, we will use them to improve the quality of the algorithm. Thanks!



## Send Us Your Feedback!
Our library is open source for research purposes, and we want to continuously improve it! So please, let us know if...

1. ... you find any bug (in functionality or speed).

2. ... you added some functionality to some class or some new Worker<T> subclass which we might potentially incorporate.

3. ... you know how to speed up or improve any part of the library.

4. ... you have a request about possible functionality.

5. ... etc.

Just comment on GitHub or make a pull request and we will answer as soon as possible! Send us an email if you use the library to make a cool demo or YouTube video!
