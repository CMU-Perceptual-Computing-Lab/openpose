OpenPose Demo - Overview
====================================

Forget about the OpenPose library code, just compile the library and use the demo `./build/examples/openpose/openpose.bin`.

In order to learn how to use it, run `./build/examples/openpose/openpose.bin --help` in your bash and read all the available flags (check only the flags for `examples/openpose/openpose.cpp` itself, i.e., the section `Flags from examples/openpose/openpose.cpp:`). We detail some of them in the following sections.



## Running on Images, Video or Webcam
See [doc/quick_start.md#quick-start](./quick_start.md#quick-start).



## Pose + Face + Hands
See [doc/quick_start.md#quick-start](./quick_start.md#quick-start).



## Maximum Accuracy Configuration
See [doc/quick_start.md#maximum-accuracy-configuration](./quick_start.md#maximum-accuracy-configuration).



## Reducing Latency/Lag
In general, there are 3 ways to reduce the latency (with some drawbacks each one):

- Reducing `--output_resolution`: It will slightly reduce the latency and increase the FPS. But the quality of the displayed image will deteriorate.
- Reducing `--net_resolution` and/or `--face_net_resolution` and/or `--hand_net_resolution`: It will increase the FPS and reduce the latency. But the accuracy will drop, specially for small people in the image. Note: For maximum accuracy, follow [doc/quick_start.md#maximum-accuracy-configuration](./quick_start.md#maximum-accuracy-configuration).
- Enabling `--disable_multi_thread`: The latency should be reduced. But the speed will drop to 1-GPU speed (as it will only use 1 GPU). Note that it's practical only for body, if hands and face are also extracted, it's usually not worth it.



## Kinect 2.0 as Webcam on Windows 10
Since the Windows 10 Anniversary, Kinect 2.0 can be read as a normal webcam. All you need to do is go to `device manager`, expand the `kinect sensor devices` tab, right click and update driver of `WDF kinectSensor Interface`. If you already have another webcam, disconnect it or use `--camera 2`.



## JSON Output with No Visualization
The following example runs the demo video `video.avi` and outputs JSON files in `output/`. Note: see [doc/output.md](./output.md) to understand the format of the JSON files.
```
# Only body
./build/examples/openpose/openpose.bin --video examples/media/video.avi --write_json output/ --display 0 --render_pose 0
# Body + face + hands
./build/examples/openpose/openpose.bin --video examples/media/video.avi --write_json output/ --display 0 --render_pose 0 --face --hand
```



## JSON Output + Rendered Images Saving
The following example runs the demo video `video.avi`, renders image frames on `output/result.avi`, and outputs JSON files in `output/`. Note: see [doc/output.md](./output.md) to understand the format of the JSON files.
```
./build/examples/openpose/openpose.bin --video examples/media/video.avi --write_video output/result.avi --write_json output/
```



## Hands
```
# Fast method for speed
./build/examples/openpose/openpose.bin --hand
# Best results found with 6 scales
./build/examples/openpose/openpose.bin --hand --hand_scale_number 6 --hand_scale_range 0.4
# Adding tracking to Webcam (if FPS per GPU > 10 FPS) and Video
./build/examples/openpose/openpose.bin --video examples/media/video.avi --hand --hand_tracking
# Multi-scale + tracking is also possible
./build/examples/openpose/openpose.bin --video examples/media/video.avi --hand --hand_scale_number 6 --hand_scale_range 0.4 --hand_tracking
```



## Rendering Face and Hands without Pose
```
# CPU rendering (faster)
./build/examples/openpose/openpose.bin --render_pose 0 --face --face_render 1 --hand --hand_render 1
# GPU rendering
./build/examples/openpose/openpose.bin --render_pose 0 --face --face_render 2 --hand --hand_render 2
```



## Debugging Information
```
# Basic information
./build/examples/openpose/openpose.bin --logging_level 3
# Showing all messages
./build/examples/openpose/openpose.bin --logging_level 0
```



## Selecting Some GPUs
The following example runs the demo video `video.avi`, parallelizes it over 2 GPUs, GPUs 1 and 2 (note that it will skip GPU 0):
```
./build/examples/openpose/openpose.bin --video examples/media/video.avi --num_gpu 2 --num_gpu_start 1
```



## Heat Maps Storing
The following command will save all the body part heat maps, background heat map and Part Affinity Fields (PAFs) in the folder `output_heatmaps_folder`. It will save them on PNG format. Instead of individually saving each of the 67 heatmaps (18 body parts + background + 2 x 19 PAFs) individually, the library concatenate them vertically into a huge (width x #heatmaps) x (height) matrix. The PAFs channels are multiplied by 2 because there is one heatmpa for the x-coordinates and one for the y-coordinates. The order is body parts + bkg + PAFs. It will follow the sequence on POSE_BODY_PART_MAPPING in [include/openpose/pose/poseParameters.hpp](../include/openpose/pose/poseParameters.hpp).
```
./build/examples/openpose/openpose.bin --video examples/media/video.avi --heatmaps_add_parts --heatmaps_add_bkg --heatmaps_add_PAFs --write_heatmaps output_heatmaps_folder/
```



## Main Flags
We enumerate some of the most important flags, check the `Flags Detailed Description` section or run `./build/examples/openpose/openpose.bin --help` for a full description of all of them.

- `--face`: Enables face keypoint detection.
- `--hand`: Enables hand keypoint detection.
- `--video input.mp4`: Read video.
- `--camera 3`: Read webcam number 3.
- `--image_dir path_to_images/`: Run on a folder with images.
- `--ip_camera http://iris.not.iac.es/axis-cgi/mjpg/video.cgi?resolution=320x240?x.mjpeg`: Run on a streamed IP camera. See examples public IP cameras [here](http://www.webcamxp.com/publicipcams.aspx).
- `--write_video path.avi`: Save processed images as video.
- `--write_images folder_path`: Save processed images on a folder.
- `--write_keypoint path/`: Output JSON, XML or YML files with the people pose data on a folder.
- `--process_real_time`: For video, it might skip frames to display at real time.
- `--disable_blending`: If enabled, it will render the results (keypoint skeletons or heatmaps) on a black background, not showing the original image. Related: `part_to_show`, `alpha_pose`, and `alpha_pose`.
- `--part_to_show`: Prediction channel to visualize.
- `--display 0`: Display window not opened. Useful for servers and/or to slightly speed up OpenPose.

- DEFINE_bool(process_real_time,          false,          "Enable to keep the original source frame rate (e.g., for video). If the processing time is too long, it will skip frames. If it is too fast, it will slow it down.");
- DEFINE_string(camera_parameter_path,    "models/cameraParameters/flir", "String with the folder where the camera parameters are located. If there is only 1 XML file (for single video, webcam, or images from the same camera), you must specify the whole XML file path (ending in .xml).");
- DEFINE_bool(frame_undistort,            false,          "If false (default), it will not undistort the image, if true, it will undistortionate them based on the camera parameters found in `camera_parameter_path`");

- DEFINE_int32(number_people_max,         -1,             "This parameter will limit the maximum number of people detected, by keeping the people with top scores. The score is based in person area over the image, body part score, as well as joint score (between each pair of connected body parts). Useful if you know the exact number of people in the scene, so it can remove false positives (if all the people have been detected. However, it might also include false negatives by removing very small or highly occluded people. -1 will keep them all.");
- DEFINE_bool(maximize_positives,         false,          "It reduces the thresholds to accept a person candidate. It highly increases both false and true positives. I.e., it maximizes average recall but could harm average precision.");

- DEFINE_bool(part_candidates,            false,          "Also enable `write_json` in order to save this information. If true, it will fill the op::Datum::poseCandidates array with the body part candidates. Candidates refer to all the detected body parts, before being assembled into people. Note that the number of candidates is equal or higher than the number of final body parts (i.e., after being assembled into people). The empty body parts are filled with 0s.

6. OpenPose Face

- DEFINE_string(face_net_resolution,      "368x368",      "Multiples of 16 and squared. Analogous to `net_resolution` but applied to the face keypoint detector. 320x320 usually works fine while giving a substantial speed up when multiple faces on the image.");

7. OpenPose Hand
