OpenPose Demo - Overview
====================================

Forget about the OpenPose library code, just compile the library and use the demo `./build/examples/openpose/openpose.bin`.

In order to learn how to use it, run `./build/examples/openpose/openpose.bin --help` in your bash and read all the available flags (check only the flags for `examples/openpose/openpose.cpp` itself, i.e. the section `Flags from examples/openpose/openpose.cpp:`). We detail some of them in the following sections.



## All Flags
Each flag is divided into flag name, default value, and description.

1. Debugging
- DEFINE_int32(logging_level,             3,              "The logging level. Integer in the range [0, 255]. 0 will output any log() message, while 255 will not output any. Current OpenPose library messages are in the range 0-4: 1 for low priority messages and 4 for important ones.");
2. Producer
- DEFINE_int32(camera,                    0,              "The camera index for cv::VideoCapture. Integer in the range [0, 9].");

- DEFINE_string(video,                    "",             "Use a video file instead of the camera. Use `examples/media/video.avi` for our default example video.");
- DEFINE_string(image_dir,                "",             "Process a directory of images. Use `examples/media/` for our default example folder with 20 images.");

## Multiple Scales
Running at multiple scales might drastically slow down the speed, but it will increase the accuracy. Given the CNN input size (set with `net_resolution`), `num_scales` and `scale_gap` configure the number of scales to use and the gap between them, respectively. For instance, `--num_scales 3 --scale_gap 0.15` means using 3 scales at resolution: (1), (1-0.15) and (1-2*0.15) times the `net_resolution`.

## Heat Maps Storing
The following command will save all the body part heat maps, background heat map and Part Affinity Fields (PAFs) in the folder `output_heatmaps_folder`. It will save them on PNG format. Instead of individually saving each of the 67 heatmaps (18 body parts + background + 2 x 19 PAFs) individually, the library concatenate them vertically into a huge (width x #heatmaps) x (height) matrix. The PAFs channels are multiplied by 2 because there is one heatmpa for the x-coordinates and one for the y-coordinates. The order is body parts + bkg + PAFs. It will follow the sequence on POSE_BODY_PART_MAPPING in [include/openpose/pose/poseParameters.hpp](../include/openpose/pose/poseParameters.hpp).
```
./build/examples/openpose/openpose.bin --video examples/media/video.avi --heatmaps_add_parts --heatmaps_add_bkg --heatmaps_add_PAFs --write_heatmaps output_heatmaps_folder/
```



## Some Important Configuration Flags
Please, in order to check all the real time pose demo options and their details, run `./build/examples/openpose/openpose.bin --help`. We describe here some of the most important ones.

- `--face`: If enabled, it will also detect the faces on the image. Note that this will considerable slow down the performance and increse the required GPU memory. In addition, the greater number of people on the image, the slower OpenPose will be.
- `--hand`: Analogously to `--face`, but applied to hands. Note that this will also slow down the performance, increse the required GPU memory and its speed depends on the number of people.
- `--video input.mp4`: Input video. If omitted, it will use the webcam.
- `--camera 3`: Choose webcam number (default: 0). If `--camera`, `--image_dir` and `--write_video` are omitted, it is equivalent to use `--camera 0`.
- `--image_dir path_to_images/`: Run on all images (jpg, png, bmp, etc.) in `path_to_images/`. You can test the program with the image directory `examples/media/`.
- `--write_video path.avi`: Render images with this prefix: `path.avi`. You can test the program with the example video `examples/media/video.avi`.
- `--write_images folder_path`: Render images on the folder `folder_path`.
- `--write_keypoint path/`: Output JSON, XML or YML files with the people pose data on the `path/` folder.
- `--process_real_time`: It might skip frames in order to keep the final output displaying frames on real time.
- `--disable_blending`: If selected, it will only render the pose skeleton or desired heat maps, while blocking the original background. Also related: `part_to_show`, `alpha_pose`, and `alpha_pose`.
- `--part_to_show`: Select the prediction channel to visualize (default: 0). 0 to visualize all the body parts, 1-18 for each body part heat map, 19 for the background heat map, 20 for all the body part heat maps together, 21 for all the PAFs, 22-69 for each body part pair PAF.
- `--no_display`: Display window not opened. Useful if there is no X server and/or to slightly speed up the processing if visual output is not required.
- `--num_gpu 2 --num_gpu_start 1`: Parallelize over this number of GPUs starting by the desired device id. Default `num_gpu` is -1, which will use all the available GPUs.
- `--num_scales 3 --scale_gap 0.15`: Use 3 scales, 1, (1-0.15), (1-0.15*2). Default is one scale. If you want to change the initial scale, you actually want to multiply your desired initial scale by the `net_resolution`.
- `--net_resolution 656x368 --resolution 1280x720`: For HD images and video (default values).
- `--net_resolution 496x368 --resolution 640x480`: For VGA images and video.
- `--model_pose MPI`: It will use MPI (15 body keypoints). Default: COCO (18 body keypoints). MPI is slightly faster. The variation `MPI_4_layers` sacrifies accuracy in order to further increase speed.
- `--logging_level 3`: Logging messages threshold, range [0,255]: 0 will output any message & 255 will output none. Current messages in the range [1-4], 1 for low priority messages and 4 for important ones.



## Rendering Face without Pose
```
./build/examples/openpose/openpose.bin --face --render_pose 0 --render_face 1
```



## Example
The following example runs the demo video `video.avi`, renders image frames on `output/result.avi`, and outputs JSON files in `output/`. It parallelizes over 2 GPUs, GPUs 1 and 2. Note that it will skip GPU 0:
```
./build/examples/openpose/openpose.bin --video examples/media/video.avi --num_gpu 2 --num_gpu_start 1 --write_video output/result.avi --write_keypoint_json output/
```
