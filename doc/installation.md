5. [FAQ](#faq)



## Requirements
- Ubuntu (tested on 14 and 16) or Windows (tested on 10). We do not support any other OS but the community has been able to install it on: CentOS, Windows 7, and Windows 8.
- NVIDIA graphics card with at least 1.6 GB available (the `nvidia-smi` command checks the available GPU memory in Ubuntu).
- CUDA and cuDNN installed. Note: We found OpenPose working with cuDNN 5.1 ~10% faster than with cuDNN 6.
- At least 2 GB of free RAM memory.
- Highly recommended: A CPU with at least 8 cores.

Note: These requirements assume the default configuration (i.e. `--net_resolution "656x368"` and `num_scales 1`). You might need more (with a greater net resolution and/or number of scales) or less resources (with smaller net resolution and/or using the MPI and MPI_4 models).





## Ubuntu
### Installation - Script Compilation
**Highly important**: This script only works with CUDA 8 and Ubuntu 14 or 16. Otherwise, check [Manual Compilation](#manual-compilation).
1. Required: CUDA, cuDNN, OpenCV and Atlas must be already installed on your machine.
    1. OpenCV can be installed with `apt-get install libopencv-dev`. If you have compiled OpenCV 3 by your own, follow [Manual Compilation](#manual-compilation). After both Makefile.config files have been generated, edit them and uncomment the line `# OPENCV_VERSION := 3`. You might alternatively modify all `Makefile.config.UbuntuXX` files and then run the scripts in step 2.
    2. In addition, OpenCV 3 does not incorporate the `opencv_contrib` module by default. Assuming you have OpenCV 3 compiled with the contrib module and you want to use it, append `opencv_contrib` at the end of the line `LIBRARIES += opencv_core opencv_highgui opencv_imgproc` in the `Makefile` file.
    3. Atlas can be installed with `sudo apt-get install libatlas-base-dev`. Instead of Atlas, you can use OpenBLAS or Intel MKL by modifying the line `BLAS := atlas` in the same way as previosuly mentioned for the OpenCV version selection.
2. Build Caffe & the OpenPose library + download the required Caffe models for Ubuntu 14.04 or 16.04 (auto-detected for the script) and CUDA 8:
```
chmod u+x install_caffe_and_openpose.sh
./install_caffe_and_openpose.sh
```



### Installation - Manual Compilation
Alternatively to the script installation, if you want to use CUDA 7, avoid using sh scripts, change some configuration labels (e.g. OpenCV version), etc., then:
1. Install the [Caffe prerequisites](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/installation.html).
2. Compile Caffe and OpenPose by running these lines:
    ```
    ### Install Caffe ###
    cd 3rdparty/caffe/
    # Select your desired Makefile file (run only one of the next 4 commands)
    cp Makefile.config.Ubuntu14_cuda_7.example Makefile.config # Ubuntu 14, cuda 7
    cp Makefile.config.Ubuntu14.example Makefile.config # Ubuntu 14, cuda 8
    cp Makefile.config.Ubuntu16_cuda_7.example Makefile.config # Ubuntu 16, cuda 7
    cp Makefile.config.Ubuntu16.example Makefile.config # Ubuntu 16, cuda 8
    # Change any custom flag from the resulting Makefile.config (e.g. OpenCV 3, Atlas/OpenBLAS/MKL, etc.)
    # Compile Caffe
    make all -j${number_of_cpus} && make distribute -j${number_of_cpus}

    ### Install OpenPose ###
    cd ../../models/
    ./getModels.sh # It just downloads the Caffe trained models
    cd ..
    # Same file cp command as the one used for Caffe
    cp Makefile.config.Ubuntu14_cuda_7.example Makefile.config
    # Change any custom flag from the resulting Makefile.config (e.g. OpenCV 3, Atlas/OpenBLAS/MKL, etc.)
    make all -j${number_of_cpus}
    ```

    NOTE: If you want to use your own Caffe distribution, follow the steps on `Custom Caffe` section and later re-compile the OpenPose library:
    ```
    chmod u+x install_openpose.sh
    ./install_openpose.sh
    ```
    Note: These steps only need to be performed once. If you are interested in making changes to the OpenPose library, you can simply recompile it with:
    ```
    make clean
    make all -j$(NUM_CORES)
    ```
**Highly important**: There are 2 `Makefile.config.Ubuntu##.example` analogous files, one in the main folder and one in [3rdparty/caffe/](../3rdparty/caffe/), corresponding to OpenPose and Caffe configuration files respectively. Any change must be done to both files (e.g. OpenCV 3 flag, Atlab/OpenBLAS/MKL flag, etc.). E.g. for CUDA 8 and Ubuntu16: [3rdparty/caffe/Makefile.config.Ubuntu16.example](../3rdparty/caffe/Makefile.config.Ubuntu16.example) and [Makefile.config.Ubuntu16.example](../Makefile.config.Ubuntu16.example).



### Reinstallation
If you updated some software that our library or 3rdparty use, or you simply want to reinstall it:
1. Clean the OpenPose and Caffe compilation folders:
```
make clean && cd 3rdparty/caffe && make clean
```
2. Repeat the [Installation](#installation) steps.



### Uninstallation
You just need to remove the OpenPose folder, by default called `openpose/`. E.g. `rm -rf openpose/`.





## Windows
### Installation - Demo
1. Install the pre-requisites:
    1. [Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 Redistributable](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=53587) (lighter) or Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 (in case you intend to install the library).
    2. [CUDA 8](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads): Install it on the default location, C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v8.0. Otherwise, modify the Visual Studio project solution accordingly.
    3. [cuDNN 5.1](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn): Once you have downloaded it, just unzip it and copy (merge) the contents on the CUDA folder, C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v8.0.
2. Download the portable demo from: [posefs1.perception.cs.cmu.edu/OpenPose/openpose_1.0.0rc2.zip](http://posefs1.perception.cs.cmu.edu/OpenPose/openpose_1.0.0rc2.zip).

### Installation - Library
1. Install the pre-requisites:
    1. Microsoft Visual Studio (VS) 2015. Install CUDA 8.0 after Visual Studio 2015 is installed to assure that the CUDA installation will generate all necessary files for VS. If CUDA was already installed, re-install it after installing VS!
    2. Install all the demo pre-requisites.
    3. [Python 2.4.13 64 bits - Windows x86-64 MSI installer](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2713/).
        - Install it on C:\Python27 (default) or D:\Programs\Python27. Otherwise, modify the VS solution accordingly.
        - In addition, open the Windows cmd (Windows button + X, then A), and install some Python libraries with this command: `pip install numpy protobuf hypothesis`.
    4. [Cmake](https://cmake.org/download/): Select the option to add it to the Windows PATH.
    5. [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org/): Select the option to add it to the Windows PATH.
2. Download the `Windows` branch of Openpose by either cliking on `Download ZIP` on [openpose/tree/windows](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose/tree/windows) or cloning the repository: `git clone https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose/ && cd openpose && git checkout windows`.
3. Install Caffe on Windows:
    1. Open the Windows cmd (Windows button + X, then A).
    2. Go to the Caffe directory, assuming OpenPose has been downloaded on `C:\openpose`: `cd C:\openpose\3rdparty\caffe\caffe-windows`.
    3. Compile Caffe by running: `scripts\build_win.cmd`. It will take several minutes.
        - Note: If Caffe asks you: `Does D:\openpose\3rdparty\caffe\caffe-windows\build\..\..\include\caffe specify a file name or directory name on the target (F = file, D = directory)?`, select `D`.
    4. If you find any problem installing Caffe, check [http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/).
4. You can now open the Visual Studio sln file located on `{openpose_path}\windows_project\OpenPose.sln`.
5. In order to verify OpenPose is working, try compiling and executing the demo:
    1. Right click on `OpenPoseDemo` --> `Set as StartUp Project`.
    2. Change `Debug` by `Release` mode.
    3. You can now compile it.
6. Download the body pose models:
    1. Download the [COCO model (18 key-points)](http://posefs1.perception.cs.cmu.edu/Users/tsimon/Projects/coco/data/models/coco/pose_iter_440000.caffemodel) as `{openpose_folder}\models\pose\coco\pose_iter_440000.caffemodel`.
    2. (Optionally) download the [MPI model (15 key-points, faster and less memory than COCO)](http://posefs1.perception.cs.cmu.edu/Users/tsimon/Projects/coco/data/models/mpi/pose_iter_160000.caffemodel) as `{openpose_folder}\models\pose\mpi\pose_iter_160000.caffemodel`.
7. If you have a webcam connected, you can test it by pressing the F5 key or the green play icon.
8. Otherwise, check [Quick Start](#quick-start) to verify OpenPose was properly compiled. In order to use the created exe from the command line, you have to:
    1. Copy all the DLLs located on `{openpose_folder}\3rdparty\caffe\caffe-windows\build\install\bin\` on the exe folder: `{openpose_folder}\windows_project\x64\Release`.
    2. Copy `opencv_ffmpeg310_64.dll`, `opencv_video310.dll` and `opencv_videoio310.dll` from `{openpose_folder}\3rdparty\caffe\dependencies\libraries_v140_x64_py27_1.1.0\libraries\x64\vc14\bin\` on the exe folder: `{openpose_folder}\windows_project\x64\Release`.





## Quick Start
Check that the library is working properly by using any of the following commands. Note that `examples/media/video.avi` and `examples/media` exist, so you do not need to change the paths. In addition, the following commands assume your terminal (Ubuntu) or cmd (Windows) are located in the OpenPose folder.

**1. Running on Video**
```
# Ubuntu
./build/examples/openpose/openpose.bin --video examples/media/video.avi
```
```
:: Windows - Demo
bin\OpenPoseDemo.exe --video examples/media/video.avi
```
```
:: Windows - Library
windows_project\x64\Release\OpenPoseDemo.exe --video examples/media/video.avi
```

**2. Running on Webcam**
```
# Ubuntu
./build/examples/openpose/openpose.bin
```
```
:: Windows - Demo
bin\OpenPoseDemo.exe
```
```
:: Windows - Library
windows_project\x64\Release\OpenPoseDemo.exe
```

**3. Running on Images**
```
# Ubuntu
./build/examples/openpose/openpose.bin --image_dir examples/media/
```
```
:: Windows - Demo
bin\OpenPoseDemo.exe --image_dir examples/media/
```
```
:: Windows - Library
windows_project\x64\Release\OpenPoseDemo.exe --image_dir examples/media/
```

**4. Body Pose and Face Keypoint Detector (e.g. on Video)**
```
# Ubuntu
./build/examples/openpose/openpose.bin --video examples/media/video.avi --face
```
```
:: Windows - Demo
bin\OpenPoseDemo.exe --video examples/media/video.avi --face
```
```
:: Windows - Library
windows_project\x64\Release\OpenPoseDemo.exe --video examples/media/video.avi --face
```

The visual GUI should show the original image with the poses blended on it, similarly to the pose of this gif:
<p align="center">
    <img src="media/shake.gif", width="720">
</p>

If you choose to visualize a body part or a PAF (Part Affinity Field) heat map with the command option `--part_to_show`, the result should be similar to one of the following images:
<p align="center">
    <img src="media/body_heat_maps.png", width="720">
</p>

<p align="center">
    <img src="media/paf_heat_maps.png", width="720">
</p>





## FAQ
**Q: Out of memory error** - I get an error similar to: `Check failed: error == cudaSuccess (2 vs. 0)  out of memory`.

**A**: Most probably cuDNN is not installed/enabled, the default Caffe model uses >12 GB of GPU memory, cuDNN reduces it to ~1.5 GB.


**Q: Low speed** - OpenPose is quite slow, is it normal? How can I speed it up?

**A**: Check the [OpenPose Benchmark](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-DynFGvoScvfWDA1P4jDInCkbD4lg0IKOYbXgEq0sK0/edit#gid=0) to discover the approximate speed of your graphics card. Some speed tips:

    1. Use cuDNN 5.1 (cuDNN 6 is ~10% slower).
    2. Reduce the `--net_resolution` (e.g. to 320x176) (lower accuracy).
    3. For face, reduce the `--face_net_resolution`. The resolution 320x320 usually works pretty decently.
    4. Use the `MPI_4_layers` model (lower accuracy and lower number of parts).
    5. Change GPU rendering by CPU rendering to get approximately +0.5 FPS (`--render_pose 1`).
