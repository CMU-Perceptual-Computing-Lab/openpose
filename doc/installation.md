## Requirements
- Ubuntu (tested on 14 and 16) or Windows (tested on 10). We do not support any other OS but the community has been able to install it on: CentOS, Windows 7, and Windows 8.
- NVIDIA graphics card with at least 1.6 GB available (the `nvidia-smi` command checks the available GPU memory in Ubuntu).
- At least 2 GB of free RAM memory.
- Highly recommended: A CPU with at least 8 cores.

Note: These requirements assume the default configuration (i.e. `--net_resolution "656x368"` and `scale_number 1`). You might need more (with a greater net resolution and/or number of scales) or less resources (with smaller net resolution and/or using the MPI and MPI_4 models).





## Ubuntu
### Installation - Script Compilation
**Highly important**: This script only works with CUDA 8 and Ubuntu 14 or 16. Otherwise, check [Manual Compilation](#manual-compilation).
1. Required: CUDA, cuDNN, OpenCV and Atlas must be already installed on your machine.
    1. [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) must be installed. You should reboot your machine after installing CUDA.
    2. [cuDNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn): Once you have downloaded it, just unzip it and copy (merge) the contents on the CUDA folder, e.g. `/usr/local/cuda-8.0/`. Note: We found OpenPose working ~10% faster with cuDNN 5.1 compared to cuDNN 6.
    3. OpenCV can be installed with `apt-get install libopencv-dev`. If you have compiled OpenCV 3 by your own, follow [Manual Compilation](#manual-compilation). After both Makefile.config files have been generated, edit them and uncomment the line `# OPENCV_VERSION := 3`. You might alternatively modify all `Makefile.config.UbuntuXX` files and then run the scripts in step 2.
    4. In addition, OpenCV 3 does not incorporate the `opencv_contrib` module by default. Assuming you have OpenCV 3 compiled with the contrib module and you want to use it, append `opencv_contrib` at the end of the line `LIBRARIES += opencv_core opencv_highgui opencv_imgproc` in the `Makefile` file.
    5. Atlas can be installed with `sudo apt-get install libatlas-base-dev`. Instead of Atlas, you can use OpenBLAS or Intel MKL by modifying the line `BLAS := atlas` in the same way as previosuly mentioned for the OpenCV version selection.
2. Build Caffe & the OpenPose library + download the required Caffe models for Ubuntu 14.04 or 16.04 (auto-detected for the script) and CUDA 8:
```
bash ./ubuntu/install_caffe_and_openpose_if_cuda8.sh
```



### Installation - Manual Compilation
Alternatively to the script installation, if you want to use CUDA 7, avoid using sh scripts, change some configuration labels (e.g. OpenCV version), etc., then:
1. Install the [Caffe prerequisites](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/installation.html).
2. Compile Caffe and OpenPose by running these lines:
    ```
    ### Install Caffe ###
    cd 3rdparty/caffe/
    # Select your desired Makefile file (run only one of the next 4 commands)
    cp Makefile.config.Ubuntu14_cuda7.example Makefile.config # Ubuntu 14, cuda 7
    cp Makefile.config.Ubuntu14_cuda8.example Makefile.config # Ubuntu 14, cuda 8
    cp Makefile.config.Ubuntu16_cuda7.example Makefile.config # Ubuntu 16, cuda 7
    cp Makefile.config.Ubuntu16_cuda8.example Makefile.config # Ubuntu 16, cuda 8
    # Change any custom flag from the resulting Makefile.config (e.g. OpenCV 3, Atlas/OpenBLAS/MKL, etc.)
    # Compile Caffe
    make all -j${number_of_cpus} && make distribute -j${number_of_cpus}

    ### Install OpenPose ###
    cd ../../models/
    bash ./getModels.sh # It just downloads the Caffe trained models
    cd ..
    # Same file cp command as the one used for Caffe
    cp ubuntu/Makefile.config.Ubuntu14_cuda7.example Makefile.config
    # Change any custom flag from the resulting Makefile.config (e.g. OpenCV 3, Atlas/OpenBLAS/MKL, etc.)
    make all -j${number_of_cpus}
    ```

    NOTE: If you want to use your own Caffe distribution, follow the steps on `Custom Caffe` section and later re-compile the OpenPose library:
    ```
    bash ./install_openpose_if_cuda8.sh
    ```
    Note: These steps only need to be performed once. If you are interested in making changes to the OpenPose library, you can simply recompile it with:
    ```
    make clean
    make all -j$(NUM_CORES)
    ```
**Highly important**: There are 2 `Makefile.config.Ubuntu##.example` analogous files, one in the main folder and one in [3rdparty/caffe/](../3rdparty/caffe/), corresponding to OpenPose and Caffe configuration files respectively. Any change must be done to both files (e.g. OpenCV 3 flag, Atlab/OpenBLAS/MKL flag, etc.). E.g. for CUDA 8 and Ubuntu16: [3rdparty/caffe/Makefile.config.Ubuntu16_cuda8.example](../3rdparty/caffe/Makefile.config.Ubuntu16.example) and [ubuntu/Makefile.config.Ubuntu16_cuda8.example](../ubuntu/Makefile.config.Ubuntu16_cuda8.example).



### Reinstallation
If you updated some software that our library or 3rdparty use, or you simply want to reinstall it:
1. Clean the OpenPose and Caffe compilation folders:
```
make clean && cd 3rdparty/caffe && make clean
```
2. Repeat the [Installation](#installation) steps.



### Uninstallation
You just need to remove the OpenPose folder, by default called `openpose/`. E.g. `rm -rf openpose/`.





## Windows
### Installation - Demo
1. Download and unzip the [portable OpenPose demo 1.0.1](http://posefs1.perception.cs.cmu.edu/OpenPose/OpenPose_demo_1.0.1.zip).



### Installation - Library
1. Install the pre-requisites:
    1. Microsoft Visual Studio (VS) 2015.
    2. [CUDA 8](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads): Install it on the default location, `C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v8.0`. Otherwise, modify the Visual Studio project solution accordingly. Install CUDA 8.0 after Visual Studio 2015 is installed to assure that the CUDA installation will generate all necessary files for VS. If CUDA was already installed, re-install it after installing VS!
    3. [cuDNN 5.1](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn): Once you have downloaded it, just unzip it and copy (merge) the contents on the CUDA folder, `C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v8.0`.
2. Download the OpenPose dependencies and models (body, face and hand models) by double-clicking on `{openpose_path}\windows\download_3rdparty_and_models.bat`.
3. Open the Visual Studio project sln file by double-cliking on `{openpose_path}\windows\OpenPose.sln`.
4. In order to verify OpenPose is working, try compiling and executing the demo:
    1. Right click on `OpenPoseDemo` --> `Set as StartUp Project`.
    2. Change `Debug` by `Release` mode.
    3. Compile it and run it with F5 or the green play icon.
5. If you have a webcam connected, OpenPose will automatically start after being compiled.
6. In order to use the created exe file from the command line (i.e. outside Visual Studio), you have to:
    1. Copy all the DLLs located on `{openpose_folder}\3rdparty\windows\caffe\bin\` on the exe folder: `{openpose_folder}\windows\x64\Release`.
    2. Copy all the DLLs located on `{openpose_folder}\3rdparty\windows\opencv\x64\vc14\bin\` on the exe folder: `{openpose_folder}\windows\x64\Release`.
    3. Open the Windows cmd (Windows button + X, then A).
    4. Go to the OpenPose directory, assuming OpenPose has been downloaded on `C:\openpose`: `cd C:\openpose\`.
    5. Run the tutorial commands.
7. Check [Quick Start](#quick-start) to test video, webcam and a folder with images, in order to verify OpenPose was properly installed.



### Uninstallation
You just need to remove the OpenPose or portable demo folder.





## Compiling without cuDNN
The [cuDNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn) library is not mandatory, but required for full keypoint detection accuracy. In case your graphics card is not compatible with cuDNN, you can disable it by:

- Ubuntu: Modifying the `Makefile.config` files in both the OpenPose and `3rdparty/caffe` folders.
- Windows: Modifying the `Makefile.config` files in both the OpenPose and `3rdparty/caffe` folders.

Then, you would have to reduce the `--net_resolution` flag to fit the model into the GPU memory. You can try values like "640x320", "320x240", "320x160", or "160x80" to see your GPU memory capabilities. After finding the maximum approximate resolution that your GPU can handle without throwing an out-of-memory error, adjust the `net_resolution` ratio to your image or video to be processed (see the `--net_resolution` explanation from [doc/demo_overview.md](./demo_overview.md)).




## OpenPose 3D Demo
If you want to try our OpenPose 3-D reconstruction demo, see [doc/openpose_3d_reconstruction_demo.md](./openpose_3d_reconstruction_demo.md).





## Quick Start
Check that the library is working properly by using any of the following commands. Note that `examples/media/video.avi` and `examples/media` exist, so you do not need to change the paths. In addition, the following commands assume your terminal (Ubuntu) or cmd (Windows) are located in the OpenPose folder.

**1. Running on Video**
```
# Ubuntu
./build/examples/openpose/openpose.bin --video examples/media/video.avi
# With face and hands
./build/examples/openpose/openpose.bin --video examples/media/video.avi --face --hand
```
```
:: Windows - Demo
bin\OpenPoseDemo.exe --video examples\media\video.avi
:: With face and hands
bin\OpenPoseDemo.exe --video examples\media\video.avi --face --hand
```
```
:: Windows - Library
windows\x64\Release\OpenPoseDemo.exe --video examples\media\video.avi
:: With face and hands
windows\x64\Release\OpenPoseDemo.exe --video examples\media\video.avi --face --hand
```



**2. Running on Webcam**
```
# Ubuntu
./build/examples/openpose/openpose.bin
# With face and hands
./build/examples/openpose/openpose.bin --face --hand
```
```
:: Windows - Demo
bin\OpenPoseDemo.exe
:: With face and hands
bin\OpenPoseDemo.exe --face --hand
```
```
:: Windows - Library
windows\x64\Release\OpenPoseDemo.exe
:: With face and hands
windows\x64\Release\OpenPoseDemo.exe --face --hand
```



**3. Running on Images**
```
# Ubuntu
./build/examples/openpose/openpose.bin --image_dir examples/media/
# With face and hands
./build/examples/openpose/openpose.bin --image_dir examples/media/ --face --hand
```
```
:: Windows - Demo
bin\OpenPoseDemo.exe --image_dir examples\media\
:: With face and hands
bin\OpenPoseDemo.exe --image_dir examples\media\ --face --hand
```
```
:: Windows - Library
windows\x64\Release\OpenPoseDemo.exe --image_dir examples\media\
:: With face and hands
windows\x64\Release\OpenPoseDemo.exe --image_dir examples\media\ --face --hand
```



**4. Maximum Accuracy Configuration**

This command provides the most accurate results we have been able to achieve for body, hand and face keypoint detection. However, this command will need around 8 GB of GPU memory and runs around 1 FPS on a Titan X.
```
# Ubuntu
./build/examples/openpose/openpose.bin --net_resolution "1312x736" --scale_number 4 --scale_gap 0.25 --hand --hand_scale_number 6 --hand_scale_range 0.4 --face
```
```
:: Windows - Demo
bin\OpenPoseDemo.exe --net_resolution "1312x736" --scale_number 4 --scale_gap 0.25 --hand --hand_scale_number 6 --hand_scale_range 0.4 --face
```
```
:: Windows - Library
windows\x64\Release\OpenPoseDemo.exe --net_resolution "1312x736" --scale_number 4 --scale_gap 0.25 --hand --hand_scale_number 6 --hand_scale_range 0.4 --face
```





## Expected Visual Results
The visual GUI should show the original image with the poses blended on it, similarly to the pose of this gif:
<p align="center">
    <img src="media/shake.gif", width="720">
</p>

If you choose to visualize a body part or a PAF (Part Affinity Field) heat map with the command option `--part_to_show`, the result should be similar to one of the following images:
<p align="center">
    <img src="media/body_heat_maps.png", width="720">
</p>

<p align="center">
    <img src="media/paf_heat_maps.png", width="720">
</p>





## FAQ
**Q: Out of memory error** - I get an error similar to: `Check failed: error == cudaSuccess (2 vs. 0)  out of memory`.

**A**: Most probably cuDNN is not installed/enabled, the default Caffe model uses >12 GB of GPU memory, cuDNN reduces it to ~1.5 GB.



**Q: Low speed** - OpenPose is quite slow, is it normal? How can I speed it up?

**A**: Check the [OpenPose Benchmark](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-DynFGvoScvfWDA1P4jDInCkbD4lg0IKOYbXgEq0sK0/edit#gid=0) to discover the approximate speed of your graphics card. Some speed tips:

    1. Use cuDNN 5.1 (cuDNN 6 is ~10% slower).
    2. Reduce the `--net_resolution` (e.g. to 320x176) (lower accuracy).
    3. For face, reduce the `--face_net_resolution`. The resolution 320x320 usually works pretty decently.
    4. Use the `MPI_4_layers` model (lower accuracy and lower number of parts).
    5. Change GPU rendering by CPU rendering to get approximately +0.5 FPS (`--render_pose 1`).



**Q: Webcam is slow** - Using a folder with images matches the speed FPS benchmarks, but the webcam has lower FPS. Note: often on Windows.

**A**: OpenCV has some issues with some camera drivers (specially on Windows). The first step should be to compile OpenCV by your own and re-compile OpenPose after that (following the `Reinstallation` section in Ubuntu or cleaning the project on Windows). If the speed is still slower, you can better debug it by running a webcam OpenCV example (e.g. [this C++ example](http://answers.opencv.org/question/1/how-can-i-get-frames-from-my-webcam/)). If you are able to get the proper FPS with the OpenCV demo but OpenPose is still low, then let us know!



**Q: Video and/or webcam are not working** - Using a folder with images does work, but the video and/or the webcam do not. Note: often on Windows.

**A**: OpenCV has some issues with some camera drivers and video codecs (specially on Windows). Follow the same steps as the `Webcam is slow` question to test the webcam is working. After re-compiling OpenCV, you can also try this [OpenCV example for video](http://docs.opencv.org/3.0-beta/modules/videoio/doc/reading_and_writing_video.html).
