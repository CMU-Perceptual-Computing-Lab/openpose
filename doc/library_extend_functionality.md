OpenPose Library - How to Develop OpenPose
====================================

If you intend to extend the functionality of our library:

1. Read the README page.

2. Check the basic library overview doc on [library_overview.md](library_overview.md).

3. Read, understand and play with the basic real time pose demo source code [examples/openpose/openpose.cpp](../examples/openpose/openpose.cpp) and [examples/tutorial_api_cpp](../examples/tutorial_api_cpp). It includes all the functionality of our library, and it has been properly commented.

4. Read, understand and play with the other tutorials in [examples/](../examples/). It includes more specific examples.

5. Check the basic UML diagram on the [UML folder](UML/) to get an idea of each module relations.

6. Take a look to the stucuture of the already existing modules.

7. The C++ headers files add documentation in [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.org/) format. Create this documentation by compiling the [include](../include/) folder with Doxygen. This documentation is slowly but continuously improved.

8. You can also take a look to the source code or ask us on GitHub.
