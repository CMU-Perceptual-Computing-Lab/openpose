## Requirements and Dependencies
Jetson TX2 just flashed with [JetPack 3.3](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetpack)

Notes:

- Installation is similar to Jetson TX1 and you can follow this [step by step tutorial](https://docs.nvidia.com/jetson/archives/jetpack-archived/jetpack-33/index.html#jetpack/3.3/install.htm%3FTocPath%3D_____3).
- If you are installing from a virtual machine host, installation may need to be done in two steps, please refer to [this solution](https://devtalk.nvidia.com/default/topic/1002081/jetson-tx2/jetpack-3-0-install-with-a-vm/).
- Be sure to complete both OS flashing and CUDA / cuDNN installation parts before installation.

**Dependencies**:

    - OpenCV (3.X versions are compatible).
    - Caffe and all its dependencies.
    - The demo and tutorials additionally use GFlags.



## Installation
Use the following script for installation of both caffe and OpenPose: 
```
./scripts/ubuntu/install_caffe_and_openpose_JetsonTX2_JetPack3.3.sh
```


## Usage
It is for now recommended to use an external camera with the demo. To get to decent FPS you need to lower the net resolution:
```
./build/openpose/openpose.bin -camera_resolution 640x480 -net_resolution 128x96
```

To activate hand or face resolution please complete this command with the following options (warning, both simultaneously will cause out of memory error):
```
--hand -hand_net_resolution 256x256
--face -face_net_resolution 256x256
```
