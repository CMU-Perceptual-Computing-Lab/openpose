OpenPose C++ API - Introduction
====================================

The C++ API is ideal if you want to e.g., change internal functions and/or extend the OpenPose functionality. In order to learn the basics:

1. Take a look at the [library Quick Start section](../README.md#quick-start) from the README.
2. OpenPose Overview: Learn the basics about the library source code in [doc/library_overview.md](./library_overview.md).
3. Extending Functionality: Learn how to extend the library in [doc/library_extend_functionality.md](./library_extend_functionality.md).
4. Adding An Extra Module: Learn how to add an extra module in [doc/library_add_new_module.md](./library_add_new_module.md).
5. See the Doxygen documentation on [http://cmu-perceptual-computing-lab.github.io/openpose/html/index.html](http://cmu-perceptual-computing-lab.github.io/openpose/html/index.html) or build it from the source code.
