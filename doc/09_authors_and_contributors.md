OpenPose would not be possible without the [**CMU Panoptic Studio dataset**](http://domedb.perception.cs.cmu.edu). The body pose estimation work is based on the following and original 2 repositories: [CVPR 2017 repository](https://github.com/ZheC/Multi-Person-Pose-Estimation) and [ECCV 2016 repository](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/caffe_rtpose).
